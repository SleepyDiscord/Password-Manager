# Password-Manager
This app can generate ,save , find and delete passwords.

In the StartUp() Function , there are three buttons to choose from : 
 
1. Generate password
2. Find password
3. Delete password
 
Then, when you select 1 of these buttons, a function should run which name is the button followed by the order , for example : Generate1 or Find_It2

The numbers represent the order of the functions, for example Generate1 is where you provide the app and the password, Generate2 is the generate button, and the Generate3 is for saving the password to MongoDB.  

This should be enough information for you to understand my project :)
